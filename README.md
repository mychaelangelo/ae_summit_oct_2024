## Summary of Talks from The AE Global Summit on Open Problems for AI (2024)

This repository contains a summary of talks from the **AE: Global Summit on Open Problems for AI**, held on **23-24th October, 2024**, in **London**. This event gathered thought leaders, researchers, and practitioners from across the world to discuss the most pressing challenges in AI and its applications.

The summaries provided here are generated using large language models, but **with human oversight and refinement** to improve clarity and accuracy. The goal of this project is to provide a structured and accessible resource for those who want to understand the key takeaways from the summit, whether you're an AI expert or someone interested in the field.

## Project Background

I attended the summit personally and took a few notes during the event. However, given the depth and scope of the discussions, I wanted a **more comprehensive summary** to help me reflect on and remember the key points covered. 

To achieve this, I used a variety of tools to **transcribe all the talks** from the summit's video streams. Below is an overview of the broad steps I followed:

1. **Audio Extraction**:  
   After attending the summit, I downloaded the video streams of the event. Using **FFmpeg**, I stripped out the audio from these recordings to prepare them for transcription.

2. **Transcription & Iteration**:  
   For speed and quality, I used [AssemblyAI's](https://www.assemblyai.com/) text-to-speech model via api to transcribe the talks. 

3. **Prompt Engineering**:  
   I iterated on several prompts to generate a few summaries, using models from both **Google's Gemini** family and **Anthropic**. Results were mixed at first. However, I then used the LLMs themselves to critique and evaluate each prompt and respective summary. By alternating between models, I gradually refined the summary prompt until I found one that produced the style I was seeking.

4. **Final Summaries Using Claude's Sonnet Model**:  
   After refining my approach, I processed the entire event through **Anthropic's Claude Sonnet model** using a well-tuned prompt with specific examples. The resulting summaries are what you’ll find here in this repository.

## Note on LLM-Generated Content

While these summaries were generated using AI models, **all content has been reviewed and lightly edited by me** to help with correctness and readability. The aim was to make the discussions from the summit accessible even to a **non-technical audience**, as long as readers take the time to familiarize themselves with some of the more technical terms that are explained here.


## Structure of the Summaries

The summaries are structured to reflect the flow of the event:

- **Day 1**: Focused on AI algorithms and research, with presentations from researchers at universities, and experts from Google DeepMind, Microsoft, and others.
  
- **Day 2**: Examined AI applications, with panels covering AI's role in education, medicine, and other real-world sectors.

Each talk has been summarized to highlight a few of the most important points.

## How to Use These Summaries

These summaries are designed to provide a **high-level overview** of the key discussions from the summit. If you're looking for more technical details, I encourage you to check out the work and research of the speakers.

Whether you're an AI researcher, a student, or simply curious about the future of AI, I hope you find these summaries helpful!

### Disclaimer
Please note that while I've made every effort to ensure the accuracy of these summaries, the **content is not an official record** of the summit. It's a personal project aimed at reflecting the event’s key takeaways, and all summaries should be viewed as interpretations rather than direct transcripts.

Thank you for visiting this project, and feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback!
