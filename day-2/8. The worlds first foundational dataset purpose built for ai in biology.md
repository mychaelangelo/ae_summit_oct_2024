### The World's First Foundational Dataset Purpose Built for AI in Biology

* **Basecamp Research is revolutionizing biodiscovery by building the world's largest commercial biodiversity database.** The company combines advanced DNA sequencing technology with a global network of partners to collect and analyze biological samples from unexplored environments. Their approach has resulted in a database several times larger than public repositories. This enables unprecedented insights into natural biological solutions.

* **Current biotechnology development is severely limited by inadequate biodiversity data.** Despite an estimated trillion species existing on Earth, less than 1% have been sequenced and characterized. The existing data suffers from geographical bias (concentrated in the Global North), taxonomic bias (focused on model organisms), and inconsistent collection methods, hampering AI/ML applications in biotechnology.

* **To democratize research, Basecamp pioneered off-grid DNA sequencing capabilities.** The company demonstrated this by successfully conducting DNA sequencing on an Icelandic glacier. This proved that advanced biological research can be performed in remote locations. The breakthrough has enabled the establishment of partner laboratories worldwide, from Costa Rican sloth sanctuaries to Maltese underwater archaeological sites.

* **Basecamp's data collection methodology captures rich contextual data beyond simple genetic sequences.** Their approach captures not just individual genes but entire genetic cassettes (groups of related genes), enabling insights into regulation, protein interactions, and biosynthetic pathways. They also document environmental conditions, creating "digital twins" of ecosystems organized in a proprietary knowledge graph.

* **Better data quality has led to significant improvements in AI model performance.** Basecamp achieved over six times greater accuracy than AlphaFold 2 in protein function prediction by using more representative and diverse data. Their advances now enable scientists to design entirely new proteins with specific desired properties.

* **The company has established partnerships across multiple sectors**. They are working with major pharmaceutical companies, consumer goods manufacturers, and environmental remediation firms. Their recent Series B funding announcement included a partnership with Professor David Liu to develop therapeutic applications in gene editing.

* **Basecamp's approach addresses ethical concerns in biodiversity research.** The UN now uses their approach as a case study for ethical access to biodiversity data. The company ensures source communities participate in biotechnology development through benefit-sharing, training, and technology transfer.
