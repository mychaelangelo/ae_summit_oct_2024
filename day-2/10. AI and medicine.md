* **The panel highlighted that business model and implementation hurdles outweigh the technical AI challenges in medicine.** Healthcare traditionally profits from treatments rather than prevention, creating a fundamental misalignment with technological innovation. Germany's digital health app regulation (DIGA) illustrated this challenge when it led to unsustainable insurance costs.

* **Consumer behaviors also present a stubbon barrier to healthcare innovation.** Despite having effective technologies, getting people to consistently use health monitoring devices proves challenging. The panel shared several examples of adoption challenges:
  - Patients with life-threatening conditions abandoned monitoring devices after just one week
  - Only 50% of U.S. patients take prescribed medications
  - Even when insurers offer specific incentives like Vitality's Apple Watch and cinema ticket rewards, engagement with health activities remains challenging

* **Data quality and accessibility remain fundamental challenges, particularly in specialized fields like psychiatry.** Unlike other medical specialties, psychiatry lacks standardized biological tests and measurements, creating a chicken-egg problem for technology development. The panel identified several key data challenges:
  - Missing data from extreme conditions and edge cases
  - Lack of standardization in clinical documentation
  - Limited access to comprehensive, well-structured datasets
  - Time delays in traditional academic publishing of results

* **The panel pointed to the NHS as an example of how healthcare bureaucracy can at times block innovation.** Despite being one of the largest integrated health services globally, lengthy implementation times and complex procurement processes make it difficult for startups to engage with the system. This highlights the need for structural changes to better accommodate technological innovation.

* **Cybersecurity and data protection present critical challenges in digital health, particularly in mental healthcare.** The panel emphasized the need for better API vulnerability protection and comprehensive breach response protocols. Most startups lack adequate cybersecurity budgets despite handling highly sensitive data, leading to:
  - Increased risk of data breaches
  - Limited victim support infrastructure
  - Potential health impacts on affected patients
  - Disruption of critical mental health services

* **Current incentive structures in healthcare often work against preventive care and early intervention.** The panel cited examples like Clinical Research Organizations profiting from longer trial durations, and insurance companies lacking motivation to invest in preventive care due to customer turnover, demonstrating how misaligned incentives hinder innovation.

* **The panel suggested that transforming healthcare requires a fundamental shift in narrative.** Rather than viewing healthcare as a reactive, doctor-centered debugging process, the field needs to move toward a proactive, patient-centered model where individuals take greater ownership of their health management. This cultural shift is as crucial as any technological advancement, and requires changes in both provider and patient mindsets.
