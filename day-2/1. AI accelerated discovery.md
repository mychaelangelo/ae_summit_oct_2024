### AI Accelerated Discovery

**James Donovan (Head of Science Policy and Partnerships at OpenAI)**

* **James Donovan shared OpenAI's approach to using AI for accelerating scientific discovery.** He explained how their O1 class of models are designed to “think before answering” - taking more time to work through problems step by step, like humans do. These models are trained to develop consistent, reliable ways of thinking about problems within specific scientific fields, rather simply provide quick answers.

* **OpenAI's approach emphasizes the understanding of domain-specific principles rather than just pattern matching.** This foundation allows models to provide more reliable and contextually appropriate responses. For example the team is teaching models to grasp fundamental concepts in fields like quantum physics and biology:
  - For quantum physics: Models learn axiomatic reasoning (building from first principles)
  - For biology: Models incorporate ”bounded answers“ (ruling out physically impossible scenarios)

* **OpenAI have demonstrated significant breakthroughs in multimodal applications combining voice, vision, and language.** Donovan highlighted several successful implementations:
  - Voice cloning that helps patients recover speech after medical procedures
  - Low-latency voice interfaces that provide medical advice in North Africa
  - Computer vision systems that guide blind users through cities
  - Environmental monitoring systems that track deforestation in the Amazon

* **OpenAI are also working Moderna and Eli Lilly to explore practical applications in drug development.** This aims to:
  - Optimize clinical trial dosing by simulating patient responses
  - Identify novel approaches to combat drug-resistant bacteria
  - Speed up the drug development process while maintaining safety constraints

* **AI models have also been trained to maintain awareness of time and context.** Rather than just providing point-in-time answers, these systems can:
  - Track changes over time (like disease progression or environmental changes)
  - Consider historical context when making predictions
  - Understand how different variables interact across different periods

* **Donovan emphasized the importance of building safeguards and verification mechanisms into AI systems.** The OpenAI team uses multiple approaches:
  - Separate world models and reasoning systems to catch different types of errors
  - Continuous monitoring of predictions against real-world data
  - Built-in constraints based on physical laws and domain knowledge
  - Partnership with domain experts to validate outputs

* **The presentation concluded with a demonstration of how research insights improve practical applications.** Using their Sora video generation system, Donovan showed how understanding physics, biology, and environmental science enables more realistic synthetic content generation. This creates a positive cycle: better simulations generate improved training data, potentially speeding up scientific discovery.
