* **The panel revealed a fundamental tension between AI literacy and AI implementation in education.** While the panelists strongly support teaching AI literacy, they advovated for the careful implementation of AI tools in schools. They emphasized the need to build trust with teachers and validation of educational outcomes before widespread AI adoption.

* **To address this tension, there are AI education initiatives that focus on foundational understanding rather than just technical skills.** The Raspberry Pi Foundation focuses on teaching critical AI awareness and avoids the anthropomorphization of AI tools. Their approach seeks to empower students as potential creators rather than passive users of AI.

* **The discussion also highlighted how physical computing can make AI education more concrete.** Micro:bit's rollout to 90% of UK primary schools demonstrates this. They embed AI concepts within existing lessons through hands-on experiences (like playground data collection and gesture recognition). This reaches more more students than specialized coding programs alone.

* **These AI education implementation strategies need to vary by economic context.** The panel discussed how Germany's engineering focus, the UK's service-based economy, and Ghana's developing status each demand different AI skill priorities. For example, in Ghana's case, the immediate need is for basic AI literacy and ethical guidelines, as teachers and students are already using AI tools like ChatGPT without formal structure or oversight.

* **Similar challenges emerge in the workplace, where hands-on learning proves essential.** Successful corporate AI education focusses more on practical applications rather than abstract concepts. For instance, executives can build their own ChatGPT agents to solve real workplace problems. This practical approach helps overcome fear of AI adoption.

* **The panel challenged traditional assumptions about "AI-proof" human skills.** Rather than investing in supposedly unique human capabilities, some panelists suggested focusing on skills that complement AI. This may include skills such as meditation and introspection, which have the potential to improve prompt engineering abilities. This represents a shift from trying to compete with AI to learning to work alongside it effectively.

* **AI's role in delivering education remains cautious but promising.** While organizations are using AI conservatively in direct education delivery, focusing on "safe" applications like translation and procedural content (such as how-to guides, technical documentation, and frequently asked questions that make up knowledge base articles), special education emerged as an early adoption area where AI's immediate benefits are clear:
  - Text-to-speech with natural-sounding voices for students with dyslexia
  - Automatic content leveling to adjust general education materials for different learning abilities
  - Personalized learning pathways for students who struggle with traditional classroom formats
  - Assistive technologies that help students with special needs participate more fully in regular classroom activities

* **Looking ahead, the panelists envisioned a future where AI applications become “tools for thought.”** They compared future educational AI to "Photoshop for thinking." These tools would let students zoom in on complex ideas and evaluate arguments. Rather than just delivering information, they would enhance how students think and reason.
