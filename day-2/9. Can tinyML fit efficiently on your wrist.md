### Can tinyML Fit Efficiently on Your Wrist and Transform Your Life?

**Professor Eiman Kanjo (Professor in tinyML Imperial College London)**

* **Kanjo introduced tinyML as an innovative approach that compresses large AI models to run on small devices.** This makes AI more accessible compared to traditional methods that require massive data centers. Think of tinyML as shrinking a warehouse-sized AI system to fit in your pocket.

* **Microcontrollers are emerging as a key enabler for edge AI applications, offering compelling advantages despite hardware limitations.** These tiny processing units cost as little as one pound and combine sensing abilities with local AI processing. While they have less memory and power than regular computers, modern microcontrollers like the Coral Edge TPU can now handle sophisticated AI models of 1-2 megabytes.

* **Engineers employ four clever techniques to compress AI models.** Kanjo highlighted the following:
  - Pruning (removing non-essential neural network connections)
  - Quantization (reducing numerical precision, from 64-bit to as low as 1-bit)
  - Knowledge distillation (training smaller "student" models from larger "teacher" models)
  - Neural architecture search (using AI to design efficient AI models)

* **Edge processing will bring unique privacy advantages for healthcare applications.** Rather than collecting and transmitting sensitive health data, tinyML devices can process sensor data locally and immediately discard it, outputting only the analyzed results. This "process-and-forget" approach addresses major privacy concerns in healthcare monitoring, which is particularly relevant as the NHS has announced plans to eventually share health records through mobile apps.

* **Three key challenges shape the future of healthcare-focused tinyML applications.** These challenges include:
  - How to manage power for devices with multiple sensors
  - How to personalize AI models directly on devices
  - How to label data in real-time for model improvements

* **Kanjo's demonstrated practical applications through their "Tag with Me" platform that promotes physical activity.** This system combines wearables, phones, and IoT devices to encourage community engagement with green spaces. The research team later adapted it for mental health facilities, showing how tinyML can support "social prescribing"â€”health interventions that don't involve medication.

* **Kanjo emphasized that widespread adoption of tinyML in healthcare remains an untapped opportunity.** While low-cost, energy-efficient microcontrollers exist and research shows promising results, the healthcare sector hasn't fully embraced these technologies. Kanjo advocated for faster implementation of tinyML in health monitoring, especially given its strengths in privacy protection and accessibility.
