### What if We Get it Right? How to Try.

* **Kharenghani argued that most organizations are just beginning to harness AI's potential.** She outlined three distinct phases of AI adoption: individual productivity enhancement, company-wide workflow optimization, and complete business model transformation. While approximately 75% of non-tech companies have experimented with ChatGPT at least once, few have progressed beyond basic implementation.

* **To move forward responsibly, organizations must establish governance structures before implementing AI.** Companies need clear internal policies and oversight to protect themselves from institutional risks. Without explicit policies, employees might use unauthorized AI tools—known as "shadow IT"—which could damage the company's reputation.

* **Beyond governance, successful AI implementation requires identifying problems first, not starting with AI as a solution.** Organizations should first pinpoint specific challenges. Then they should determine which problems need technological solutions. Finally, they must evaluate if AI fits the need. CEOs and boards must support decisions to build AI capabilities in-house, buy them, or partner with others.

* **As companies implement AI, they must consider its environmental impact.** Khareghani shared concerning data about AI's resource use:
  - One AI-generated 100-word email requires 500ml of fresh water to cool data centers
  - If 10% of working Americans used this weekly, they would consume 435 billion liters of water annually
  - Data centers require significant energy and cooling resources
  - Companies must consider renewable energy sources and grid infrastructure

* **Companies must prioritize workforce training to succeed with AI adoption.** Studies show that 60% of businesses already rely heavily on advanced digital skills, and this need continues to grow while the tech sector faces severe talent shortages. Moreover, research from the Pissarides review reveals that digitally prepared workforces adapt better to new technologies and maintain higher job satisfaction. 

* **Khareghani points to the UK's Responsible AI UK programme as a comprehensive approach to fostering responsible AI development.** This initiative aims to:
  - Connect researchers and innovators across the UK and internationally
  - Fund research addressing pressing issues like LLM limitations in medical and legal contexts
  - Support projects across multiple sectors from healthcare to defense
  - Facilitate international collaboration through research sandpits and partnerships

* **Future workforce considerations must extend beyond current employees to address broader societal impacts.** Khareghani highlighted the development of the first AI Workers Bill, created in consultation with trade unions, to address:
  - Changing nature of work
  - Worker protections and benefits
  - Organizational responsibilities
  - Framework for managing AI-driven workplace transformation
