### War and Peace and Artificial Intelligence

* **Akord AI is using AI to support peace negotiations and conflict resolution.** As AI Innovation Lead at Conflict Dynamics International, Hilal introduced their "copilot for peace." This AI system supports civil society leaders, peacebuilders, and negotiators in conflict zones. The organization draws from 20 years of experience in regions like Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, Syria, and Nigeria.

* **The fundamental philosophy driving their work centers on inclusive political processes as key to lasting peace.** Current conflict resolution often sidelines crucial voices like civil society organizations, women's groups, and youth groups. Hilal illustrated this through a striking example: a young civil society activist from Darfur joined the Addis Ababa negotiations with deep local knowledge. However, she lacked specialist expertise and research capabilities, putting her at a disadvantage.

* **Surprisingly, peace negotiators also often lack access to fundamental documents.** Hilal shared a striking example: Sudan's seven previous constitutions remain locked behind academic firewalls at institutions like Stanford and Durham. In one recent case, negotiators had to rely on memory to reference a 1956 constitutional clause because they couldn't access the original document.

* **Building on these insights, Akord AI's platform delivers six core features to transform peace negotiations.** The platform combines:
  - AI-powered peacebuilding insights trained on principles of independence, impartiality, and neutrality
  - A Web2-based digital archive of essential historical documents
  - Automated Chicago-style citations for verifiability
  - Specialized tools and frameworks
  - Document import/export capabilities
  - Multilingual support (currently Arabic and English)

* **The platform's value is currently being tested in Sudan's ongoing negotiations.** It's in beta with around 100 users. Negotiators use it to access standard protocols for ceasefire agreements. They can reference historically significant documents like the Nuba Mountain ceasefire agreement of 2003 while drafting new agreements according to best practices. The system uses OpenAI's technology while maintaining accuracy through a curated data lake where every answer can be traced back to its original source.

* **Three significant challenges limit the platform's deployment in conflict zones.** These challenges include:
  - Adoption barriers in conflict zones where AI usage is unfamiliar and text-based interfaces present obstacles
  - Data scarcity in conflict-affected countries where institutions have collapsed
  - The fundamental nature of war itself, driven by human emotions like fear, greed, and ambition rather than lack of intelligence

* **Looking ahead, Hilal outlined an ambitious 18-month roadmap for expanding Akord AI's capabilities.** The team will extend coverage to more conflict zones including Sudan and Syria. They'll add voice functionality, WhatsApp integration, predictive analytics, and more languages.

* **Hilal concluded with a crucial observation about AI's dual nature in conflict.** He argued that AI will inevitably enhance both our capacity for war (as seen in Gaza, Lebanon, and Ukraine) and peace. He emphasized that achieving positive outcomes requires deliberate effort to ensure AI serves "the better angels of our nature" rather than destructive impulses. This means rebalancing our current heavy investment in military AI applications.
