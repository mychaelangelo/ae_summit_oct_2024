### Introductory Remarks

**Dr. Ruairidh McLennan Battleday, MD, PhD (AI and Cognitive Science Researcher, Harvard & MIT)**

***

* **Dr. Battleday introduced AI's context and growing relevance in modern society.** As founder of “Thinking About Thinking,” he traced AI's evolution from Alan Turing's work in the UK to its current status as a daily discussion topic. Public understanding varies widely across different groups.

* **He presented modern AI through the lens of machine learning.** Traditional computing relies on direct programming. Machine learning, in contrast, learns from pairs of inputs and outputs. Among the many machine learning approaches, neural networks—flexible computer systems that learn patterns similar to how our brains process information—have become dominant.

* **The talk spotlighted two revolutionary AI developments:**
  - DeepMind's AlphaFold: It predicts how proteins twist and fold into precise 3D shapes. This 3D structure determines how proteins function in our bodies and interact with medicines
  - ChatGPT: It uses autoregression—a process where the model predicts each next word by analyzing all previous words in the sequence. This allows it to maintain context and coherence across long passages of text

* **Dr. Battleday compared this summit to climate change conferences in structure and purpose.** This event brought together diverse stakeholders to discuss:
  - Cutting-edge AI algorithm challenges
  - Real-world application hurdles
  - Ways to direct AI development toward social benefits

* **He advocated for a “meso scale” language in AI discussions.** This middle-ground vocabulary would connect:
  - Technical algorithm concepts
  - Broader discussions about AI capabilities
  - Practical impacts in daily life

* **The summit's agenda focused on two key areas:**
  - Day 1: Algorithm deep-dives with experts from Google DeepMind and Microsoft
  - Day 2: Real-world applications, exploring AI in education and medicine
