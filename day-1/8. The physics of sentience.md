### Sociotechnical Limitations of LLMs

**Professor Karl Friston (Wellcome Principal Research Fellow at UCL & Scientific Director at Verses AI)**

* **Friston presented a unified theory of how intelligent systems maintain and organize themselves.** He showed how the same basic principles can explain everything from single cells to brains and AI systems, approaching this through physics, biology, and behavior.

* **At the foundation of this theory are 'Markov blankets,' which act as boundaries defining distinct systems.** They are like a cell membrane: it separates inside from outside while allowing controlled interaction through:
  - Sensors that take in information (like our eyes and ears)
  - Active parts that affect the outside world (like our muscles)

* **Using these boundaries, self-organizing systems maintain their structure by avoiding unexpected situations.** They do this by minimizing what Friston calls "surprise" (technically measured as the negative log probability of states) through:
  - Perception: Understanding what's happening in the environment
  - Action: Making changes to stay within expected states
For example, when we feel too hot, we perceive this unexpected state and act by moving to shade.

* **This process manifests in the brain through constant prediction and verification.** Our brain makes unconscious guesses about what's causing our sensory experiences. When you hear footsteps, your brain predicts it's a person walking; when you hear meowing, it predicts a cat. These predictions update automatically when wrong.

* **Building on these predictions, true intelligence emerges through imagination and self-awareness.** Beyond just reacting, intelligent systems need:
  - To imagine future outcomes (like a chess player thinking ahead)
  - Understand themselves and plan deliberately
  - Develop these 'emergent' abilities naturally through complex processing

* **These principles culminate in Friston's free energy principle, which explains curiosity and learning.** According to Friston, just as scientists seek to resolve uncertainty through experiments, intelligent systems are driven by "expected information gain" - they naturally explore to resolve uncertainty about their environment. This intrinsic motivation to gather information (what neuroscientists call "epistemic affordance") explains why organisms are curious and how they learn efficiently.

* **These insights fundamentally shape how we should approach AI development.** Friston argued against developing AI in isolation. Natural intelligence depends on learning from others and structured environments. This suggests AI systems might develop better through human interaction, similar to how children learn.
